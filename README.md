Project Description: PCOS Information Platform

What Problem am I Solving?
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects millions of women globally, with prevalence rates estimated at 6-12% of women of reproductive age. Despite its commonality, PCOS is often underdiagnosed, misunderstood, and stigmatized, leaving many women struggling to access reliable, digestible information about their condition. The problem is twofold: 
	Lack of Accessible Information: Women with PCOS often face difficulty finding credible, up-to-date resources tailored to their needs, especially in non-medical language. This can lead to delayed diagnosis, poor management, and emotional distress.
	Fragmented Knowledge: Healthcare providers and communities lack centralized, easy-to-access platforms that aggregate the latest research and practical advice for PCOS management, making it harder to support affected individuals effectively.
	Lack of accessible, localized health information
	Misconceptions or misinformation online
	Few affordable care options or directories
	Overwhelming medical content not designed for laypeople


This project aims to empower women with PCOS and their communities by providing a simple, user-friendly platform that aggregates recent research articles, presents them in an accessible format, and offers insights into the condition. The goal is to bridge the gap between complex medical research and everyday understanding, fostering better self-management and informed discussions with healthcare providers.
Why Does This Matter?
For women with PCOS, timely and accurate information can lead to earlier diagnosis, better lifestyle choices, and improved health outcomes, reducing risks like infertility, diabetes, and mental health challenges. For communities, especially in regions with limited healthcare access, a centralized resource can educate and reduce stigma. Businesses, such as health tech startups or clinics, benefit by integrating such a platform to enhance patient engagement and trust.

What Tools Did We Use?
To address this problem, I designed a lightweight Python-based web application with the following tools:
	Python: The core programming language for its simplicity and robust libraries for web scraping and web development.
	BeautifulSoup: Used for scraping PubMed, a free, publicly accessible database of biomedical research, to collect recent articles on PCOS. PubMed’s API (E-Utils) is straightforward and requires no API key, making it ideal for this project.
	Requests: A Python library to handle HTTP requests for fetching data from PubMed’s API.
	Flask: A minimal web framework to create a simple website displaying scraped articles in a table format. Flask is lightweight, making it suitable for a basic, user-friendly interface.
	Pandas: Used to structure scraped data into a clean, tabular format for display on the website.
	JSON: Chosen for data storage due to its simplicity and compatibility with web applications, allowing easy sharing and future integration.
	Health APIs: To get AI-powered summaries of pcos-related topics(optional)
	Google maps API: To show the nearest gynecologists or women’s clinics


Geospatial analysis or large-scale data processing wasn’t necessary. The focus was on simplicity and accessibility, ensuring the solution could run on minimal infrastructure (e.g., a personal computer) without costly dependencies.
How Did We Approach It?
The idea stemmed from recognizing the challenges women face in navigating PCOS-related information. Many rely on scattered online forums or outdated websites, which can be overwhelming or unreliable. I explored PubMed as a data source because it’s a trusted repository of peer-reviewed medical research, offering a wealth of information without the need for paid APIs. The choice of a Flask-based website was driven by the need for a simple, deployable solution that could be accessed by non-technical users, such as women seeking information or small clinics wanting to share resources.

The technical process involved:
1.	Data Collection: Using PubMed’s E-Utils API to search for recent articles on PCOS and fetch details like titles, abstracts, authors, and publication dates.
2.	Data Cleaning: Ensuring scraped data was formatted cleanly (e.g., truncating long abstracts, handling missing fields) to make it user-friendly.
3.	Presentation: Displaying the data in a table on a Flask website, stored as JSON for portability.
4.	Error Handling: Implementing checks for connection issues or missing data to ensure reliability.

I prioritized simplicity by limiting the scope to 10 recent articles, avoiding complex features like user accounts or advanced filtering, which could be added later based on user feedback.

Insights to Discover?
The primary goal was to uncover and present actionable insights from recent PCOS research, such as:
1.	Emerging Treatments: Highlighting new medical or lifestyle interventions (e.g., dietary changes, medications) that could improve symptoms like irregular periods or insulin resistance.
2.	Prevalence and Awareness: Identifying studies that discuss PCOS prevalence or diagnostic challenges, helping women understand they’re not alone.
3.	Mental Health Connections: Exploring research linking PCOS to anxiety or depression, which could validate users’ experiences and encourage seeking support.
4.	There’s an Overload of Information — But a Lack of Trusted, Understandable Help
5.	Many Women Don’t Realize They May Have PCOS
6.	Access to Female-Centric Clinics Is Poorly Documented
7.	Women Don’t Just Need Info — They Need Emotional Reassurance


The “aha!” moment was realizing how much high-quality, freely available research exists but is locked behind jargon-heavy formats. By simplifying abstracts and presenting them in a clean table, we aimed to make these insights accessible to non-experts, empowering women to take charge of their health.

 What Solutions Do I Offer, and Are They Needed?
The solution is a simple web platform that:
1.	Aggregates Recent Research: Displays the latest 10 PubMed articles on PCOS, including titles, authors, publication dates, and shortened abstracts.
2.	Simplifies Information: Presents data in a clear, tabular format, avoiding medical jargon overload.
3.	Stores Data: Saves articles as a JSON file for offline access or sharing with healthcare providers.
4.	Ensures Reliability: Includes error handling for network issues or missing data, ensuring the platform remains functional.

This solution is needed because:
1.	Women with PCOS often feel isolated or confused by conflicting online information. A trusted, centralized resource can reduce anxiety and guide decision-making.
2.	Healthcare providers in underserved areas can use this platform to stay updated on PCOS research without needing expensive journal subscriptions.
3.	Community organizations can share the platform to educate and reduce stigma, especially in regions where reproductive health is taboo.
4.	Millions of women turn to Google and YouTube to self-diagnose PCOS symptoms
5.	Low-income and rural populations have less access to quality OB-GYNs and health education.
6.	NGO and government programs lack accessible, tech-powered tools to scale awareness.
7.	Mental health and emotional support are often ignored in reproductive health education.

 How Does This Benefit Businesses or Communities?
The platform delivers tangible value:
1.	For Women with PCOS: Saves time and emotional energy by providing a single, reliable source of information, potentially reducing misdiagnoses or ineffective self-treatment. For example, learning about a new dietary approach could improve symptoms, saving on medical costs (e.g., ~$500/year on unnecessary supplements).
2.	For Clinics and Health Tech Startups: Enhances patient engagement by offering a free tool to share with clients, building trust and potentially increasing retention. Clinics could save on staff time spent explaining PCOS basics, streamlining consultations.
3.	For Communities: Reduces stigma by normalizing discussions about PCOS, especially in conservative regions. Community health programs could use the JSON data to create educational materials, improving outreach efficiency.
4.	For Researchers or Educators: Provides a quick way to access recent studies, saving hours of manual searching on PubMed.

Why This Approach?
The focus on simplicity—using free APIs, minimal tools, and a lightweight Flask app—ensures the platform is accessible to users with basic internet and no budget for premium services. PubMed’s E-Utils API was chosen because it’s free, reliable, and doesn’t require complex authentication, unlike many commercial APIs. The JSON output allows flexibility for future integrations (e.g., mobile apps or chatbots), while the table-based display caters to users who want quick, visual insights.

This project isn’t just about scraping data—it’s about empowering women and communities with knowledge that’s often out of reach. The real value lies in turning dense research into a tool for better health decisions, one article at a time.
